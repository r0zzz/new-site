Her people's survival is a constant, desperate battle against the elements, forcing them to raid Noxians, Demacians, and Avarosans alike to survive the harsh winters. Sejuani herself spearheads the most dangerous of these attacks from the saddle of her dr√ºvask boar Bristle, using her True Ice flail to freeze and shatter her enemies."
