Having won her power through an encounter with the long-imprisoned demon of joy, she has no emotions other than unceasing jubilationâ€”a small price to pay for the vast strength she now possesses. Channeling the demon's liquid form into a blade of unparalleled might, she stands defiant against ancient threats long forgotten."
