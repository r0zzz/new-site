Armed with immense arcane power and a boundless constitution, he tirelessly hunts for World Runesâ€”fragments of the raw magic that once shaped the world from nothingness. He must retrieve these artifacts before they fall into the wrong hands, for Ryze understands the horrors they could unleash on Runeterra."
