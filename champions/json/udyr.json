He seeks balance within, so that his mind does not get lost amidst others, but he also seeks balance withoutâ€”for the Freljord's mystical landscape can only thrive with the growth that comes from conflict and struggle, and Udyr knows that sacrifices must be made to keep peaceful stagnance at bay."
