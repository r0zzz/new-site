While his kin devour or defile everything around them, he seeks instead to scrutinize and study the physical realm—and the strange, warlike beings that dwell there—for any weakness the Void might exploit. But Vel'Koz is far from a passive observer, striking back at threats with deadly plasma, or by disrupting the very fabric of the world itself."
