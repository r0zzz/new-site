A perfect expression of the Void's desire to consume all life, Cho'Gath's complex biology quickly converts matter into new bodily growthâ€”increasing its muscle mass and density, or hardening its outer carapace like organic diamond. When growing larger does not suit the Void-spawn's needs, it vomits out the excess material as razor-sharp spines, leaving prey skewered and ready to feast upon later."
